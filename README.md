# js-css-html-14-projects-14-days-minni-challenge-

This repository is dedicated to JavaScript projects aimed at building a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals. Just like the previous challenge on HTML and CSS, this repository focuses on core JavaScript concepts through 14 different projects.

Each project is designed to help you understand how JavaScript works behind the scenes, unraveling the true power and beauty of the language. While the front-end may appear simple, the logic that powers these projects demonstrates the depth and flexibility of JavaScript. By the end of this repository, you will have a solid grasp of JavaScriptâ€™s potential and how to use it effectively.

Happy coding and learning!
